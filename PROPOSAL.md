# IDEAS:

1 A recreation of the puzzle game [Baba Is You](https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/). The game will be composed of pushable blocks of text that form the rules of the world, and can be pushed to change those rules. We want to have around 3-5 levels for the player to try to solve.

2 A recreation of the puzzle game [Snakebird](https://store.steampowered.com/app/357300/Snakebird/). The game is a version of snake with gravity mechanics, and the goal of the game is to reach every collectible fruit, and then enter the portal at the end. Our goal is to have around 5 levels for this version.

3 A partial recreation of the platformer [Celeste](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/). It is a platformer that involves a playable character who has one midair dash, that refreshes when they are on the ground, or when hitting a midair dash refresh. We would like to implement the momentum mechanics, though that may be a bit too overambitious for this project. The scope of this proposal would involve 1-3 screens of gameplay.
