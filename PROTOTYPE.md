# Technical Details:

Snakebird is a puzzle game, based on the hit game Snake, with the added twist of gravity to interractions. Each level involves fruit that the player must collect, and then must reach a portal at the end. The game is organized in a small grid. The player will fall down if there are no tiles directly below any of their segments.

## Critical Features:
- Moveable player that is influenced by gravity.
- Collectible fruit that can be marked as collected, and opens an end goal once all have been collected, and ending the level when that happens.
- A reset key in case the player gets softlocked or fails the level
- Multiple levels that the player can progress through

## Optional Features:
- Undo key to undo the last action
- Spike obstacle that immediately fails the stage if the player lands on it
- Multiple snakebirds (difficult) that the player can swap between with a button
