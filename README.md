# Project Description

Snakebird is a challenging puzzle game that's based on the hit game Snake. Levels may involve fruit, just like in normal Snake, that the player must collect before reaching a portal at the end. The game is organized in a compact grid with blocks and fruit placed in positions designed for the player to get stuck. Not only does the player have to navigate getting stuck tight rooms, they may also find themselves falling off into the water or dying to spikes. Snakebird combines simple movement with complex puzzle design and many different puzzle elements to make a fascinatingly complex game.
