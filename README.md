# Project Description

Snakebird is a puzzle game, based on the hit game Snake, with the added twist of gravity to interactions. Each level involves fruit that the player must collect, and then must reach a portal at the end. The game is organized in a small grid. The player will fall down if there are no tiles directly below any of their segments.

# Intended usage:

The user will be able to control a snakebird using the arrow keys. The goal is to collect all the fruits in the level, and then enter the goal at the end. Once a level is completed, the player will be able to enter the next level (may replace with a level select later)
